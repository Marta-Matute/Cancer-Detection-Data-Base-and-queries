## Introduction
In this repository we find a project where we work with the design, implementation and queries for a database in MongoBD. We'll use data about Lung Cancer Detection, taken from the research funded by ATTRACT in the project ToPiomics, Radiomics for Early Detection of Lung Cancer. 

## Goals
Our main objective for this project will be to create a data base using MongoDB in such way that we can answer the following queries:
1. Different Scanners that we find on the data base. Sow the device.
2. Total number of nodules used for the training in experiment 1 of method 2. 
3. Maximum, minimum and average value for Benign Precision grouped by classification. Show the method ID, maximum benign precision, minimum benign precision and average benign precision. 
4. Total number of men and women. Show gender and total number.
5. Patients with more than two nodules. Show Patient's ID, gender, age and diagnosis. 
6. Show the 4 methods with the most repetitions in the experiment. Show the Method's ID and the number of repetitions for the experiment. 
7. For each of patient, the number of scanners that were done. Show the patient's ID, device and date of the computed tomography. 
8. Show the patients whose all nodules are Benign and the total count. 
9. Modify the parameter ResolutionTV increasing it by 20% from the scans that took place on 18/11/2018.
